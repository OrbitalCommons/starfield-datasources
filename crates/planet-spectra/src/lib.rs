//! Spectral geometric albedos of the planets, Titan and the major moons.
//!
//! Renderers that place a *resolved* solar-system body on a focal plane need
//! three separable things: where the light comes from on the disk (an albedo
//! map), how it scatters with illumination geometry (a photometric function),
//! and what colour it is (a spectral albedo). This crate is the third.
//!
//! # What this crate is not
//!
//! An albedo is a dimensionless reflectance. It is not a spectrum, a radiance
//! or a flux, and [`SpectralAlbedo`] deliberately implements no trait that
//! would let it be mistaken for one. Turning an albedo into photons at a
//! detector needs the solar spectrum and the heliocentric and observer
//! distances — geometry that belongs to `starfield` and radiometry that
//! belongs to the consumer. Consumers multiply through themselves.
//!
//! # Geometric versus full-disk albedo
//!
//! The archive this crate embeds does not report one single quantity, and the
//! difference is worth several percent on the two brightest targets. Jupiter
//! and Saturn are tabulated as full-disk albedos at 6.8° and 5.7° phase; Uranus,
//! Neptune and Titan as geometric albedos at zero phase. Every spectrum carries
//! its [`AlbedoKind`] so the distinction cannot be lost by accident. Converting
//! a full-disk albedo to a geometric one needs a phase function, which this
//! crate does not yet ship.
//!
//! Saturn's column is the globe at zero ring tilt — the rings are excluded, and
//! they dominate Saturn's real appearance.

//! let table = KarkoschkaTable::load_embedded()?;
//! let neptune = table.albedo(SpectralBody::Neptune).expect("Neptune is tabulated");
