//! Endmember surface reflectance spectra for resolved-body rendering.
//!
//! A global albedo map is one number per texel, but a real surface is a mixture
//! of a few materials whose *colours* differ. Multiplying a monochrome map by a
//! single disk-integrated spectrum gives a body whose colour is uniform and only
//! its brightness varies — visibly wrong for Mars and the Moon, the two bodies
//! most likely to be rendered large. Decomposing each texel into a few
//! endmembers with distinct spectra is what makes colour vary across the disk.
//!
//! This crate supplies the endmember spectra. The mixing fractions come from the
//! map crate; the radiometry stays with the consumer.
//!
//! # Source
//!
//! USGS Spectral Library Version 7 (Kokaly et al. 2017, USGS Data Series 1035,
//! doi:10.5066/F7RR1WDJ), a public-domain laboratory-measured library.
//! Reflectance is AREF (absolute reflectance), dimensionless.
//! `scripts/build_table.py` regenerates the embedded table from the archive and
//! records the curation.
//!
//! # Coverage is per-endmember and is not hidden
//!
//! The endmembers do not share a wavelength range: splib07 measured them on
//! different spectrometers, and deleted channels it could not calibrate. Most
//! span the silicon detector range, but [`Endmember::WaterIce`] **starts at
//! 859 nm** — splib07's only water-ice spectrum has no visible coverage at all.
//!
//! Rather than pad that gap, every accessor reports honestly: asking for a
//! visible-band mean of water ice returns `None`. A consumer that needs visible
//! ice must source it elsewhere, and this crate makes that obvious at the call
//! site instead of returning a fabricated number.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```
//! use starfield_reflectance_library::{Endmember, EndmemberMix, ReflectanceLibrary};
//!
//! let library = ReflectanceLibrary::load_embedded()?;
//!
//! // Vegetation's red edge: a steep rise between 680 and 750 nm.
//! let leaf = library.get(Endmember::GreenVegetation).unwrap();
//! let ratio = leaf.at_nm(750.0).unwrap() / leaf.at_nm(680.0).unwrap();
//! assert!(ratio > 4.0, "red edge ratio {ratio}");
//!
//! // A half-snow, half-vegetation texel, averaged over a red band.
//! let mix = EndmemberMix::new(vec![
//!     (Endmember::Snow, 0.5),
//!     (Endmember::GreenVegetation, 0.5),
//! ]);
//! let mean = mix.band_mean(&library, 600.0, 700.0).unwrap();
